Do you think my parents still love one another?
?yesLove: Thats why they fight / NoLove: They're only together because they're scared of being alone

$yeslove
...
They fight because they care? I don’t think I’ve fought about anything before. Are there other ways to care or am I incapable of it... 
...I think if they really cared, the fights would lead somewhere that wasn’t more fighting.

I’ve never thought about adults being scared before. When you see a movie, they’re always brave and heroic. 
?moviesNotReal: Movies aren't real life / scaredAdults: There's probably movies about adults who are scared

$moviesnotreal
I know that, but real life should be more like movies I think. Movies have romance, and spectacle. In a movie you can talk to a stranger and go on an adventure together and make life long friends 

$scaredadults
What kind of things are adults scared of? Being alone. Death. I don’t think adults fear the Bermuda triangle, or alien invasions.
I wouldn’t want to make any movies about scared people unless it was about overcoming their fear.
Like they fly over the Bermuda triangle and get sent to this strange world, but they overcome it on this big adventure.

$FaveMemory
When I was younger, we were on holiday. My mum and I were late for this pottery class, and we asked one of the locals the route home. 
They gave us this shortcut that sent us through this tiny graveyard. I stopped to look at one of the graves, and it was unmarked.
All of them were. All the people buried there don’t have an identity because no one could recognize them.
It was sad but it felt sort of peaceful. I wanted to spend more time there.

$WorstMemory
I’m not sure. Its hard to remember anything Id call my least favourite memory. 
I hate bad memories the closer they are. Like right now, this car journey is my least favourite memory. 
In 5 years hopefully ill have had worse experiences so this isnt my worst memory.
