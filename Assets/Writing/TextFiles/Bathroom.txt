Who are you. This bathroom is for men or women. Your not allowed here.
hehehe
trespassers have to play my game. I've stolen your skeleton, and if you want it back you'll have to play
Behind one of these three cubicles is your silly human bones. 
You have to guess one of the doors, and then I'll show you a door that DOESNT have your skeleton behind it.
After that, you get to choose to stick with your first choice like a coward, or put on a brave face and change
Hurry up and choose a door. hehehe
