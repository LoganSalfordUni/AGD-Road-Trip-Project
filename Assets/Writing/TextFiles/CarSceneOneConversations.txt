Do you consider yourself to be a romantic?

$romantic2
I did mean romantic in the sense of seeing beauty in everything, but that’s cool too.  I don’t think I’d ever fall in love with anyone personally. 
//oaef need a command to play music 
I think the world is quite beautiful though. So in one sense I'm a romantic, and in the other I'm not.
When I'm older, I wanna live in the woods and make films about nature
Sometimes I wonder if most people, or even everyone, is a romantic. How can you not appreciate the beauty of the world?
Maybe to be a romantic its about what you prioritise.
!gotoauto/two
...Instead of the beauty of the world, what things freak you out? What are you scared of? Ill start
Eyes, any animal bigger than a cat, noises birds make
?romantic3:Loud noises, abandoned spaces, mirrors

$romantic3
The ocean, the Bermuda triangle, being trapped in a fridge
?romantic4:Death, storms, public speaking

$romantic4
Going to the dentist, being alone, not knowing if people want to hurt you
?romanticHurt:Do you usually think people are going to hurt you?/romanticContinue:Ghosts, heights, people whose name starts with the letter J

$romantichurt
Sometimes, I guess it depends. Everyone could hurt me so I think its safer to assume the worst. Even the people who don't want to hurt you might do on accident.

$romanticcontinue
Mirrors, my fingernails growing too long, fire

What's your favourite instrument? Mine is the harp. I love the sound it makes, and they look so cool
!gotoauto/diner
You dont get to hear the harp much though, I can't think of any songs with one in. I wonder why
Maybe they dont get along well with other instruments. 
Maybe its because they're hard to get around. Theyre big and have an awkward shape
