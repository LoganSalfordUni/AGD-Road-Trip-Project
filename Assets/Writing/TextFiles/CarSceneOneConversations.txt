/Conversation 3 - Romantics 
$romantic
Do you consider yourself to be a romantic? 
?romanticDinosaur: I was banished from my triceratops tribe for being in love with a teradactyl /romanticVenus: I’m from the planet Venus. I travelled to earth to re-unite with an earthling astronaut I met 90 million years ago

$romantic2
I did mean romantic in the sense of seeing beauty in everything, but that’s cool too.  I don’t think I’d ever fall in love with anyone personally. 
//oaef need a command to play music 
I think the world is quite beautiful though. So in one sense I'm a romantic, and in the other I'm not.
When I'm older, I wanna live in the woods and make movies with no characters in them
Sometimes I wonder if most people, or even everyone, is a romantic. How can you not appreciate the beauty of the world?
Maybe to be a romantic its about what you prioritise. 
...Instead of the beauty of the world, what things freak you out? What are you scared of? Ill start
Eyes, any animal bigger than a cat, noises birds make
?romantic3:Loud noises, abandoned spaces, mirrors

$romantic3
The ocean, the Bermuda triangle, being trapped in a fridge
?romantic4:Death, storms, public speaking

$romantic4
Going to the dentist, being alone, not knowing if people want to hurt you
?romanticHurt:Do you usually think people are going to hurt you?/romanticContinue:Ghosts, heights, people whose name starts with the letter J

$romantichurt
Sometimes, I guess it depends. Everyone could hurt me so I think its safer to assume the worst. Even the people who don't want to hurt you might do on accident.
